# Mission Pad Challenge 1

In this challenge, you will line up 4 mission in a line, spaced about 3-6 feet apart.

Make sure all the Rocket Ships are pointing in the same direction, the direction of travel

Start with the RoboMasterTT on a mission pad at one end.

Write a program that will have the RoboMasterTT fly in a line, from mission pad to mission pad.  Along the way as the RMTT is over a mission pad, pause and display the number of the mission pad and blink the top LED blue.

After the short pause move either in the positive X direction to the next mission pad and do the same.

At the last mission pad, rotate 180 degrees, and come back down the line.

At the starting mission, after displaying the mission pad number, land on the mission pad.
